Why does this app need permission to read and write files?
-To run properly, iMultiplier like most mobile applications requires specific
permissions on the use of phone features.
To be able to import images from the photo gallery and the information to be
incorporated therein, the user must grant the necessary permissions on reading and writing photos.

Why does this app need to use the AccessibilityService API?
-For app functionality only: This app uses the AccessibilityService API to enable the user
the ability to automatically share generated images with WhatsApp friends.
iMultiplier offers the ability to share user-generated images. Sharing can be
controlled or automatic. The user can share the images via a third-party application
that he has previously chosen from the list proposed by the phone's operating system.
However, if the user needs to transfer images to several recipients, on WhatsApp for
example, he must repeat this process for each of them. To save time, the user can
automate the simultaneous sharing on Whatsapp of images generated with iMultiplier
with personalized messages to several recipients. To do this, he will be asked to
grant accessibility to the button for sending a message on WhatsApp.

Does this app collect and/or share personal or sensitive data using the accessibility capabilities?
-No
