3. Sharing and accessibility
****************************

iMultiplier offers the ability to share user-generated images. Sharing can be controlled or automatic. The user can share the images via a third-party application that he has previously chosen from the list proposed by the phone's operating system. However, if the user needs to transfer images to several recipients, on WhatsApp for example, he must repeat this process for each of them. To save time, the user can automate the simultaneous sharing on Whatsapp of images generated with iMultiplier with personalized messages to several recipients. To do this, he will be asked to grant accessibility to the button for sending a message on WhatsApp.
